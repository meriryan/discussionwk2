        <h2 class="coke-pepsi">Coke vs Pepsi</h2>
        <p>I’m a Coke fan, especially Coke Zero, because it’s basically Coke with all the charm and none of the sugar-induced guilt. It’s like having your cake and eating it too — except the cake is a perfectly carbonated black can that whispers, ‘you’re making responsible choices, but still fun ones.’ Pepsi tries, but Coke Zero is the one that figured out how to make zero sound like a win.</p>

        <h2>Fountain Pop</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fountain: </strong>The undisputed champion. Coke from the fountain isn’t just a drink — it’s a lifestyle. The perfect fizz-to-syrup ratio makes every sip taste like it was crafted by tiny soda sommeliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Can:</strong> A strong runner-up. Portable, cold, and with that satisfying pshhht when you crack it open, it’s basically Coke’s travel-sized magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottle:</strong> Let’s be honest… it’s Coke with commitment issues. Somehow flatter, somehow sadder — like the soda equivalent of reheated fries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A Brief History of Pop (with Extra Fizz)</h3>
        <p>Pop first bubbled onto the scene in the late 1800s, when pharmacists decided medicine tasted better with sugar, carbonation, and a splash of mystery syrup. What started as a “health tonic” quickly became the liquid happiness we now call soda—or “pop,” if you’re from the Midwest and insist on regional accuracy.

        The Midwest, in particular, took to pop like corn takes to butter. Maybe it’s the endless road trips across flat highways, maybe it’s the Friday night football games, or maybe it’s just that nothing cuts through a casserole quite like an ice-cold Coke. Whatever the reason, Midwesterners elevated fountain pop to sacred status. Gas stations became shrines with self-serve soda machines, and every town has that one magical spot where the fountain mix is rumored to be “just better.”

        In the Midwest, pop isn’t just a drink—it’s a cultural glue. It’s the bubbly soundtrack to family gatherings, church potlucks, and late-night Meijer runs. To call it “soda” around here is basically blasphemy.</p>
